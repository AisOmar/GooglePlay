- Type

- Price 

- Content Rating

**Goal of the Project**

I came up with five different business questions and my goal is answer them. Please find questions below:

- #### What quantitative feature is the most correlated to a rating of apps?

- #### What category has the highest amount of apps?

- #### What is the average rating of the apps in different categories?

- #### Can we predict the rating of apps based on the other features in the dataset?

- #### What are the most important features determining the rating of the apps?



**Prediction**

The target of prediction is a rating column. This is a regression model. I will be predicting continues variable.
